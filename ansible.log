2018-07-04 00:44:13,430 p=30922 u=ashok |  ERROR! the role 'hxpro.nginx' was not found in /home/ashok/development/ansible2/roles:/home/ashok/.ansible/roles:/usr/share/ansible/roles:/etc/ansible/roles:/home/ashok/development/ansible2

The error appears to have been in '/home/ashok/development/ansible2/yumrepos.yml': line 6, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  roles:
    - role: hxpro.nginx
      ^ here
